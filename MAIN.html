        <h1> COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT</h1>
        <div class="Overview">
            <p class="overview_text"> The Computer Science Department focuses on building capacity in computer algorithms through research and training, 
                shaping academic discussions in computer literacy. It leverages knowledge in the growth and utilization of modern 
                technology and equipment for complex computing. The department is dedicated to delivering competency-based training, 
                facilitating the setup of computer system software for individuals and corporate entities, thereby advancing the 
                application of modern computing technology in the professional realm. It plans to champion continuous efforts in a 
                broadly-based computing discipline, encompassing hardware, software development, computer programming, software engineering, 
                software testing, as well as installation, maintenance, and repair of computer systems. These areas equip students with technical 
                skills to address emerging industry problems, forming the foundation for research and graduate studies. Upon program completion, 
                graduates gain high-quality real-world experience, preparing them with mid-level expertise in the progression of computer technology 
                in the industry. </p>
